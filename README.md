# hello-world
the torment of saint anthony

Putting together a github because I'm finally getting around to picking up Python.
Haven't attempted to program in quite some time and I want more progress this time around.
Background in finance and tired of waiting on data science to get me requests/speccing requests that takes as much time as it would for me to do it myself.

Also interested in webscraping, statistical modelling, feature development, and looking at risks and their indicators in novel ways.
